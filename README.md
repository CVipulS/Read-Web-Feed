# Introduction 
I had been following various subject's experts blogs as a novice. There were NNTP clients and mailing lists that came with browsers. Then there were online readers. When beginning with full time work after freelancing, I began doing C++ development with BlackBerry 10 SDK Cascades derivative of Qt, and feed reading was amongst early app ideas. While developing for Windows later, I stumbled with issues of how resizing window affects content. I've been using that for vodcasts and podcasts nevertheless. For articles with images though, the publisher's hosting service's resizing trigger seemed to neglect blogging client, requiring to navigate to the item's link url. So here I am reimagining the experience to be browser based for regular blogs.
